# Violet Box

Right now, very little is written except the groundwork for a MacOS 9 system extension in C. This extension should serve as "guest additions," allowing for easier capture of window data from `qemu-system-ppc`.

Violet Box is a recreation of the Classic environment that used to exist in early versions of Mac OS X for modern systems. It'll hopefully be a tool designed to bring the Classic Mac OS experience to modern computers running macOS versions >10.

Violet Box is intended to be an easy-to-use and intuitive way to bring back the classic Mac OS experience. It will enable users to run their classic Mac applications and games on modern systems, making it easy to use the same software they loved on their old systems. Violet Box is still in the early stages of development.
